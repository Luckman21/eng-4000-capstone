# ENG-4000-Capstone
Our repo for ENG 4000 F2024 - W2025.  This is where we will store project documents, code and other resources related to our team.

Important files/folders include: 

**microcontroller:** stores the files responsible for sensor data acquisition and display

**nextjs-fastapi:** main application folder containing the database schema, backend methods, frontend displays and system tests

**Final Report:** the jewel of any capstone project is the report! Our document provides a comprehensive overview of the system's functionality and its design process
