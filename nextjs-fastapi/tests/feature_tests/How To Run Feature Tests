** HOW TO RUN FEATURE TESTS **

So we have our tests as a local project for the time being.
This means you need to:

1. Download your own chromedriver
2. Change the driver path to your own
3. (Before running the test), turn on the front and back end localhosts
4. Run the tests.

Bonus: If you want to see what the test is doing, turn headless off.
